# PlayCation

Plans for this application:

Develop a full stack (MERN) application that allows users to sign up, create profiles, and upload images of locations they have visited
- Front end will be developed in React as a Single Page Application
- Followed by building a REST API using NodeJS and Express
- Then connecting MongoDB to the back end to store individual user login information.
- Authentication and Authorization will be handled with encryption (bcrypt) and JSON Web Tokens (jsonwebtoken)

# 5/24/2021
- Scaffolding the front end using create-react-app 
- basic folder structure so far is: 
- places-->components + pages
- shared-->components
- user-->components + pages
After installing react-router-dom some basic routes were routes were established and everything was working ~~fine~~ WHY DON'T MY ROUTES WORK PROPERLY????
